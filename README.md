Now-a-days most of the people are using the drugs without any information about the causes of those drugs interactions,so to help them to know about it we created an AI tool "Drug interaction detection system."
Our AI tool consists of feature like uploading the image, that helps the people who are unable to study also access.It is easier to understand by all ages because it has the color codes of red for danger and green for
non-harmful.
Thank you!
